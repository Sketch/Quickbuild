Small features:

* Add ROOM FLAGS command
* Add EXIT FLAGS command

* Complete "IN" and "ON" parsing
 - Might not be possible due to MPP, in which case I scrap MPP.

* Add INCLUDE command
 - Handled recursively in process_file() in .each .each. Easy

* Add STARTING-IN command
 - STARTING-IN specifies that the room the user is standing in is X
 - (also considering a STARTING-ON, but you can't be -IN- an exit.)

* Add DESC(RIBE) command
 - Shorthand for IN "Name" \n @describe here=TEXT \n ENDIN

* Add '&' command
 - Shorthand for IN "Name" \n &attr here=text \n ENDIN

* Handle tagged exits correctly
 - Figure out how to get the DBRef # of opened exits.
 - @listen may be the best option.

Big features:
* No-@teleport building.
 - Add a depth-first search to the graph and walk in while building instead
   of teleporting around everywhere
 - In command-style, may require fancy @dig operations. Might be impossible?

* Denser modern PennMUSH building output / sidefx
 - New PennMUSH will let you build remotely.
 - @set me=ATTR_BASE.ID:[dig()], instead of @teleporting around.

* Add partial grid constructions
 - Let the user define a number of DBrefs for prebuilt rooms and exits.

* Check @quota before building begins.
 - How do we kill the rest of the building commands after a check!?

* Add frontends to print out building for MOOs/MUDs

* Rewrite README documentation.

FEATURE CREEP:
* Improve ChatChart
 - Arrows for which direction the exits go
 - Unicode 8-way arrays for hockey-stick drawing mode
 - Graph rigidity for N/S/E/W exits.

From old quickbuild:
* Add the ability to read daVinci files so we can draw room layouts using
  graphical tools!
