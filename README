Quickbuild is a Ruby script that lets you quickly lay out a MUSH area (a set of rooms connected by exits, optionally zoned and/or parented) in an easy-to-use format. It converts this file into uploadble MUSH code. It's smart about cardinal directions (aliases and reverse exits), <b>racket style, and a few other things.
